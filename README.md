# FunWithAMSI
A repo to hold any bypasses I work on/study/whatever. The current contents:

- Bypasses from https://crawl3r.github.io/2020-05-22/AMSI_Resurrecting_the_dead
  - 1_global_strings
  - 2_broken_up_strings
  - 3_base64_strings
  - 4_decimal_to_ascii
  - 5_raw_offset



When it comes to using these don't be a dick, keep learning and have fun.

### License  
I'm just a simple skid. Licensing isn't a big issue to me, I post things that I find helpful online in the hope that others can:  
 A) learn from the code  
 B) find use with the code or   
 C) need to just have a laugh at something to make themselves feel better  
  
Either way, if this helped you - cool :)
